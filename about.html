<h3>History</h3>
<p> 
Luis Agote (second from right) overseeing one of the first safe and effective blood transfusions in 1914
While the first blood transfusions were made directly from donor to receiver before coagulation.
 it was discovered that by adding anticoagulant and refrigerating the blood it was possible to
 store it for some days, thus opening the way for the development of blood banks. John Braxton 
 Hicks was the first to experiment with chemical methods to prevent the coagulation of blood at
 St Mary's Hospital, London in the late 19th century. His attempts, using phosphate of soda,
 however, were unsuccessful.
The first non-direct transfusion was performed on March 27, 1914 by the Belgian doctor Albert 
Hustin, though this was a diluted solution of blood. The Argentine doctor Luis Agote used a much
 less diluted solution in November of the same year. Both used sodium citrate as an anticoagulant.[1]</p>
 <h3>First World War</h3>
 <p>
 The First World War acted as a catalyst for the rapid development of blood banks and transfusion techniques.
 Canadian Lieutenant Lawrence Bruce Robertson was instrumental in persuading the Royal Army Medical Corps to
 adopt the use of blood transfusion at the Casualty Clearing Stations for the wounded. In October 1915, Robertson
 performed his first wartime transfusion with a syringe to a patient suffering from multiple shrapnel wounds.
 He followed this up with four subsequent transfusions in the following months and his success was reported to 
 Sir Walter Morley Fletcher, director of the Medical Research Committee.

Robertson published his findings in the British Medical Journal in 1916 and, with the help of a few like minded 
individuals (including the eminent physician Edward William Archibald who introduced the citrate anticoagulant method),
 was able to persuade the British authorities of the merits of blood transfusion. Robertson went on to establish the
 first blood transfusion apparatus at a Casualty Clearing Station on the Western Front in the spring of 1917.[2]

Oswald Hope Robertson, a medical researcher and U.S. Army officer was attached to the RAMC in 1917, where he was
 instrumental in establishing the first blood banks, in preparation for the anticipated Third Battle of Ypres.[3]
 He used sodium citrate as the anticoagulant and the blood was extracted from punctures in the vein and was stored 
 in bottles at British and American Casualty Clearing Stations along the Front. He also experimented with preserving 
 separated red blood cells in iced bottles.[2] Geoffrey Keynes, a British surgeon, developed a portable machine that could 
 store blood to enable transfusions to be carried out more easily.
